# The JupyterLab interface

In this slide deck we will learn about the different parts of the JupyterLab interface and how to navigate them effectively

# The JupyterLab interface

Notes:

JupyterLab is equipped with a lot of features in traditional Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) such as PyCharm and VSCode. However, JupyterLab is geared towards interactive and exploratory computations.

The JupyterLab interface mainly consists of a **main work area**, and a **left sidebar**. You'll spend most of your time using these two elements of the JupyterLab interface for various tasks.

We will explore both of these elements in detail in the next slides.

# Left sidebar

Notes:

Here you can see various tabs of the left sidebar:

- (1): This tab is the file explorer, which you can use to navigate your file system, open the files you're looking for, or even create and rename files and much more. You can right-click on any file or folder to see available options.

- (2): This is the running terminals and kernels tab. Here you can see all open tabs in the working area, as well as all running kernels. A kernel is a running language engine connected to your notebooks. We'll learn about these later.

- (3): This is the Git extension tab. You've used it extensively in the previous chapters to version-control your repositories.

- (4): This is your table of contents tab. Whenever you insert Markdown headings to your notebooks, they will automatically show up here and will help you easily jump to any specific section of your notebook. You can also show code cells in the table of contents and expand and collapse sections to get a quick overview of your notebook.

There is also an Extension Manager tab which we will talk about in more detail in later sections of this module.

# Main work area

Notes:

The main work area is where all your working windows reside. Here for example, we have opened:

- a notebook,
- an image file,
- an IPython console, and
- a terminal.

The content of each window, as well as the toolbars (and whether or not you get one!) depends on the type of the file you opened (e.g. notebook, image, PDF), and the type of the window (e.g. whether it's a console or a terminal).

You can resize the windows as you wish and change their arrangement by dragging the grey margin area between them.

You can also drag and drop a tab to another window to make it part of that window, or you can do the reverse.

## Simple mode

Notes:

If you want to maximize a particular open tab so that you can focus on it, you can do so by

- first clicking the tabs title bar to activate it (note the thin blue bar appearing at above the title when you activate a tab),
- then clicking the "Simple" toggle button which is located on the lower left part of the JupyterLab's interface in the status bar.

Here, I have focused on my notebook tab.

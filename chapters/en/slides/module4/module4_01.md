# Viewing the history of a project

There are two ways you can view the Git history of a project:

1. On GitHub through the repo's code commit view
2. On your local machine using `git log`

# 1. Viewing the history of a project: GitHub

On GitHub, on the repo's landing page click "*N* commit" link (where *N* is the number of commits made on the repo)

<center>

<img src='/module4/vc-local-github.png' width="40%" alt="404 image"/>

</center>

Notes: Now we have a project, but only 2 commits (the initial creation and adding us as the author). Let's now add a couple more commits to generate a history that we can view and experiment with by editing our README.md.

# 2. Viewing the history of a project: the Terminal

`git log --oneline`

<center>

<img src='/module4/vc-local-github.png' width="40%" alt="404 image"/>

</center>

Notes: How similar are the local and webpage log views?? Do you get the same information from both? Which seems easier to read/navigate?

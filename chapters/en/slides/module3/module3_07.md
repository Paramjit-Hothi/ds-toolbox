# What Did we Learn and What to Expect in Assignment 3


---
## Module Learning Outcomes

In this module you learned how to:

1. Differentiate between the use of GitHub as a remote hosting service for version control and Git as a version control system.
2. Identify a Git repository.
3. Implement Git's `clone`, `add`, `status`, `commit`, `pull`, and `push` operations on the command line and their equivalent use in the JupyterLab IDE.
4. Understand what implies using the staging area in a Git workflow.
5. Recognize the commit as the primary building block for storing a project version characterized by an attached message and a hash that serves as a unique identifier. 

Notes: It is now time to put into practice everything we have learned!

Notes:
Once you have made one or more commits that you want to share with your collaborators,
you need to push (i.e., send/upload) those commits back to GitHub. 
This updates the history in the remote repository (i.e., GitHub) to match what you have in your local repository. 
Now when collaborators interact with the remote repository, 
they will be able to see the changes you made.
You can also take comfort in the fact that your work is now backed up in the cloud!

**Click the "Push" button**

To push your staged and committed changes to GitHub,
first open the Git extension in Jupyter Lab and
press `push` button 
(click on the cloud icon with the up arrow on the Jupyter Git tab which is circled in red in this slide).

If everything went well, you will read a message on the screen 
informing you that the push was successful.

You can now navigate to the GitHub web interface to see that your changes have been uploaded.
There you will see a preview of the commit message,
and the time of the most recently pushed commit for each file.

We could also push from the terminal instead of from the Jupyter Lab Git extension.
If you would like to push from the terminal you can execute the command `git push`.

Notes: Now let's see how these graphics change once we merge the branches together. While on the master branch type git merge lecture-todo to merge the commits from the lecture branch into the master branch. You will notice that git opened your default editor, this is because you need to create a merge commit that represents bringing the changes from lecture-todo into master. Press Ctrl + S to save the message that popped up and then exit VS Code. You have now merged your branch! Let's see how that looks graphically: (If some other editor than VS Code pops up, please run this git config --global core.editor "code --wait" to set VS Code as your default editor from now on).

# Merging branches

We are spending this much time on understanding where you are between branches and commits because it is common that Git learners get lost which causes a lot of confusion. Once you have a solid understanding of where you are in the Git commit tree, it will be easier for you to work with branches and forks.

## What is a branch?

Notes:

It is time to learn about branches! 

A branch is a pointer to a snapshot of your work that was taken at a specific commit. Working with branches enables you to continue developing from there in isolation of your principal changes in the `main` branch.
This is beneficial since you don't want the repository's default branch to be updated with every commit of a half-finished feature. When a feature is finished, their branches will be merged into the `main` branch. The separation of features from the main branch facilitates parallel development where progress can be made on multiple independent features simultaneously.

To illustrate feature-based development with a practical example we can use the construction of a house. First, you need to build the foundation. Since everything depends on the foundation being built, this would be developed on the `main` branch. When the foundation is finished the construction of other parts of the house that don't depend on each other could take place in parallel, e.g. some contributors might start working on the walls and others on the floor. When either of these features is finished, it can be added back to the house (what would be similar to merged into `main`). When depicted graphically, this process would look something like this (each dot in the image represents a commit).

## When should a new branch be opened?

When we initiate a repository by default we start working on the `main` branch, but we can be working in paralell in other features.

Notes:  In the image we can see that two branches were created from `main`. The first snapshot was taken after the second commit to include there the trained model. The second branch was initiated in the third commit to fix one of the exploratory analysis plots. At the end we merge all these branches to `main` so the isolated modifications are included in our principal source of code.

When should a new branch be opened?
Generally speaking, you can assume that every modification that has the potential to break the original code is a good one to attempt to fix without taking the risk of working in the `main` branch.


Note that in some old repositories the default branch could be called `master` instead of `main`.

## How to create a branch? (JupyterLab)

Notes: To create a branch in JupyterLab you have to go to **Branches > New branch** and then write the name of the branch there. If you want to create the new branch based on another branch than `main` you can click and select it in the menu. You can always switch easily between branches on the **Branches** tab.

In this scenario, we create the branch from `main` or from `origin/HEAD` and `origin/main`. We already know that `main` is the default branch, but what about `origin` and `HEAD`? Let's review some concepts:

* `main` is your default local branch.
* `HEAD` is poiting where you currently are (in this case, on the `main` branch)
* `origin` is a nickname for your remote repo on GitHub (instead of showing the full URL), so `origin/main` is the `main` branch of the version of the repo you pushed to GitHub.com.
   You don't need to care about `origin/HEAD`, it just point to the default remote branch, which will always be `main` unless you mess around with the settings on the GitHub webpage.

In JupyterLab you can see this information as labels under the tab **Changes**.

‚ö†Ô∏è Here we added a new synonym for a GitHub repository. Previously, we were using `remote` as a way to refer to any GitHub repo. Now we can refer to the specific GitHub remote we are working on with the nickname `origin`.

## How to create a branch? (terminal)

<center>

Notes: 

You can see the `origin/HEAD`, `origin/main` and `main` displayed in the terminal when you check the history of your project, in the example with `git log --oneline`.

The command `git switch` command can be used to alternate between existing branches. If a branch does not yet exist, you can append the `-c` flag to create the branch as you switch to it. Let's create a new branch! Type `git switch -c <branch-name>`, to create and switch to this branch.



üôå

To practice working with branches, let's try adding a commit to one of your example repositories and check what happens in JupyterLab (tab **Changes**) and with the command line (running the command `git log --oneline`):
1. Before and after doing a commit.
2. Before and after pushing to the remote.

# How to create a branch? (terminal)

<img src='/module5/branches-head.png' width="85%" alt="404 image" />

Notes: 


Let's see what happens when we make a commit locally. 

1. Edit your README to append one more line of your choice, then add it to the staging area and commit it.

2. Run `git log --oneline`

As expected, only the reference to where we are currently (HEAD) and the local main branch moved, because we have not pushed the changes to our GitHub remote (`origin`). If you push your changes, the GitHub `main` branch (`origin/main`) will also be updated with the latest commit local commit. To confirm this, you can run `git log --oneline` after pushing the new commit to GitHub.

# Pushing a new branch

<center>

<img src='/module5/pushing-new-branch.png' width="85%" alt="404 image" />

Notes: Pushing a new branch using JupyterLab is exacly the same as you are used to with the "push" button. However, there is a slight change in the command when you are pushing a branch you created locally with the terminal. Instead of `git push` you will have to write:

`git push --set-upstream origin <new-branch-name>`

This command decides what the new branch will be called on the remote GitHub repo. It is recommended that you use the same name as you use locally, and using a different name is rarely necessary. You don't need to worry about remembering this command, because git will remind you in the case you forget to specify it as you can see in the image.

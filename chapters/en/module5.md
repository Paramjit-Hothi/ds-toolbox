What of this names refer to the default branch in Git/GitHub?

<choice>
<opt text='<code> master </code>'>
Right, but there is also another correct option.
</opt>
<opt text='<code> HEAD </code>'>
<code> HEAD </code> is providing valuable information to the user when checking the project history. Specifically will point to the last commit in the origin and in the local repository.
</opt>
<opt text='<code> main </code>'>
Right, but there is also another correct option.
</opt>
<opt text='<code> origin </code>'>
<code> origin </code> is referring to the remote GitHub repository.
</opt>
<opt text='2, 3 and 4 are correct'>
<code> main </code>, <code> origin </code> and <code> HEAD </code> are concepts that provide valuable information to the user when checking the project history, but 2 of them not necessary refer to the default branch.
</opt>
<opt text='1 and 3 are correct' correct='true'>
<code> master </code> was the old name for the <code> main </code> branch. You still will find repositories you can contribute to that uses <code> master </code> as the default branch.
</opt>
<opt text='2 and 3 are correct' >
Only one of this options is correct.
</opt>
</choice>

When do you need to open a new branch?

<choice>
<opt text='It is the first thing you should do after you start a project. You open a branch for all the features you are planning to add to your code' >
You can not predict when you will have a bug to fix. Also, remember that you will open a branch from the stage your project currently is. Are you sure that would have sense to open all of them at the beggining of the project?   
</opt>
<opt text='When you want to make a change that can break the code in the <code> main </code> branch'>
Right, but there is also another correct option.
</opt>
<opt text='You can create a branch when you decide to add a new feature'>
Right, but there is also another correct option.
</opt>
<opt text='You can create a branch to fix a bug, and then merge it to <code> main </code> '>
Right, but there is also another correct option.
</opt>
<opt text='All are correct '>
Remember that you will open a branch from the stage your project currently is. Are you sure that would have sense to open all of them at the beggining of the project?

You clone a repository from Github with a README file to your own computer. After that, you create a new branch locally called 'app' and commit three times. What labels will include your most recent commit? 

<choice>
<opt text='<code>origin/HEAD</code> and <code>origin/main</code>'>

</opt>
<opt text='<code> HEAD -> app </code> ' correct='true'>
Head is pointing to the last place you make changes and that was in the app branch
</opt>
<opt text='<code> main </code>'>

</opt>
<opt text=' <code> HEAD -> main </code>'>
Remember that you will open a branch from the current stage of your project. Are you sure it makes sense to open all of them at the start of the project?  
</opt>
<opt text='<code> app </code>'>

<exercise id='4' title='Observing the trees'>

**True or False**

The labels <code> origin/main </code> and <code> origin/HEAD </code> always will be associated to the more recent commit in the history of a project that you have just cloned from GitHub.

<choice>
<opt text='True'>
What happens if the last change in the GitHub repository was in a different branch than <code> main </code>. You can try in your computer what happens!
</opt>
<opt text='False'  correct='true' >

The term `origin` refers to the remote repository. If the last change in the remote repository you are cloning was in other branch than <code> main </code> the labels in the most recent commit will be (HEAD -> new-branch, origin/new-branch)

</opt>
</choice>

*git log --oneline --all --graph*

* a949e61 2020-09-13 (HEAD -> master) Update readme
| * 0a8dfef 2020-09-13 (lecture-todo) List todo items
|/
* 6e69947 2020-09-13 (origin/master, origin/HEAD) Add a line to readme
* 0d5a6f7 2020-09-13 Initial commit

Select the options that are TRUE

<choice>
<opt text='The most recent commit on GitHub was performed in the master branch'>
You can recognize the latest commit on GitHub with the label <code> origin/HEAD </code>
</opt>
<opt text='There is a branch called <code> lecture-todo </code> that has not been pushed to GitHub yet '>
The labels <code> origin/master, origin/HEAD </code> that points the last change in the remote are downstream. This means that a949e61 and 0a8dfef were created after pulling or cloning from GitHub.
</opt>
<opt text='The last local change of this repository has associated the commit message "Update readme"' >
The last commit is always the one that appears first. <code> HEAD -> master </code>

<choice>
<opt text='Yes, to avoid having extra copies of the code that you do not need anymore' >

</opt>
<opt text='Yes, I am not going to develop more on it' correct='true'>
</opt>
<opt text='No, I could be loosing important information' >
Once the branch has been merged all the information is combined. If the merge was successful no information could be missing.
